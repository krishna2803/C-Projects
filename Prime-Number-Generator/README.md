# Prime Number Generator
Generate Prime numbers **up-to** a given number using [`sieve of eratosthenes`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Algorithm_and_variants) algorithm.  

## Usage  
Compile `main.c`. And run it from terminal (Command Prompt in Windows). It takes an unsigned integer input from `stdin`.

### Remarks
Using this script, I was able to generate prime numbers up-to 100000000 *(99999989 being the last prime)* in less than 10 seconds. Size of the file created in the process was 51099000 bytes (51.1 MB).  
I created this script for making my own version of **Prime Spiral** which is beautifully explained by 3Blue1Brown in [this](https://youtu.be/EK32jo7i5LQ) video.
